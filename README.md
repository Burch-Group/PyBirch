Laboratory measurement architecture. Integrates with PyMeasure instruments to run scans over arbitrary dimensions, all from a simple, intuitive GUI. Tracks sample fabrication history using LablinQR extension; and passes data to a Wandb interface for real-time data visualization, storage and management.

### Database Web Interface

PyBirch includes a built-in database web application for managing laboratory resources. The database provides:

- **Sample Management**: Track samples with fabrication history, QR codes for physical labeling, and linked procedures
- **Precursor Tracking**: Manage chemical precursors with lot numbers, suppliers, and safety information
- **Equipment Registry**: Catalog laboratory equipment with maintenance schedules and documentation
- **Procedure Library**: Store and version fabrication procedures with step-by-step instructions
- **Project Organization**: Group related samples, equipment, and procedures by project
- **Issue Tracking**: Built-in issue reporting for bugs and feature requests
- **User Authentication**: Google OAuth integration for secure access

To run the database web interface:
```bash
cd database
python run_web.py
```
Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

- [ ] ask members of teams
- [x] Add the ability to individually delete all types of database objects in the UI
- [x] allow visualizations to be saved into the images section of the corresponding sample
- [x] allow users to edit scans and queues to add links to samples and projects that may be missing
- [x] For image uploads in general, remove the drag & drop box (it is too large & clutters the UI), instead allow users to drop images onto the gallery (as is standard in other well-established applications)
- [x] add QR code option beside all search-select dropdowns that allows a QR code to be scanned, and inputs the resulting object if it is of the correct type, etc.
- [x] Add file uploads with optional name & description. The UI should be like image uploads are currently, with drag and drop over the section & manual file selection options. These should be implemented everywhere image uploads are allowed. Acccept all standard file types, as well as scientific types like .kdf design files, gwiddeon afm files, etc. Make adding new acceptable file types easy to do (in case it is necessary for developers in the future.)
- [x] Add issue timeline
- [x] add recurring maintenance tasks to equipment, which open a predefined maintenance issue after a given wait, and begin the wait again after that issue is resolved. They should be editable and deletable add confirmation modal after loading qr code with main image (if available) name & details (optipns confirm, retry, cancel)
- [x] add a legend option to line & scatter visualizations. <10 datapoints it plots each line/ set of points & gives a regular legend (sorted by color (same setting as heatmap color) in numerical or alphabetical order), or as a colorbar legend on the side if >10 datapoints, labeled with letters or numbers. clicking on a datapoint will give a small tooltip of the item it comes from.
- [x] add a settings page for the user, with common settings. Implement those settings. Then add a dark mode for the website (with a dark/light mode switch button in the top right to the left of the login button -- icons should be a sun and moon, using svg styles as is standard across the website). Finally, add custom themes. The user should be able to add/save/delete/edit custom themes (with names), and in each customize all of the colors of the website with a custom palette. Each theme should have a "light mode" and a "dark mode" palette. Implement all of this using industry standard formats. Research what these are if necessary.


- [x] change drivers to accept folders as well as individual files, to allow for dependencies to be included. create a file naming convention for the file in which the instrument definition resides, and specify it on the driver page. add a "files" section with all the files (keeping in mind there may be folders within the uploaded folder). keep the source code section, display the source code of the file with the instrument definition.


- [ ] add characterizations. connect to equipment, samples. Have type, json results, files & images
- [ ] add analyses. take data file(s) csv. output data file csv & images. python code, with dependencies. naming convention like drivers, and autorecognition. can apply analysis to scans. can push images to scan image gallery, tells user where they came from. For data transparency
- [ ] Add waste objects as first-class database objects. They will link to precursors, samples, and locations. 
- [ ] maybe subscriber class, with items like slack channels or email groups. user email & slack notifications are treated as a recipient with one address (only difference is that it is edited in the profile). can be configured with standard/custom notifications upon various lab events


- [ ] split into inventory & data sections. too large now
  add featured (not starred) tag. limit of one for images
    add permissions page to all objects. can view local lab permissions, but also options to add guests, or share between labs. At the bottom lists shared labs & shared guests for that item (editable, unless inherited), as well as if that permission is inherited from a parent and which one.
    add option to average & plot stdv error bars on line & scatterplot if there exist multiple datapoints per position
- [ ] think about mixing chemicals. how is that supported?
- [ ] Invigilator, access to lab objects but not projects

- [ ] allow to share equipment with users or with labs. They may create issues and view the equipment & its issues, but that is all.
- [ ] Allow users to make issues open to public suggestions, or publically visible, both resolved and unresolved. Add forum pages.
- [x] add multiple y values and legend for line plot
- [ ] Automations -- emails, slack notifications, api calls to other databases; simple / template configurable
- [ ] notifications for users (essentially preset automations) which can be enables in email or slack for any of: scan status change, queue status change, issue assignment, assigned issue status change, assigned equipment status change, site-wide issue status change, new creation of new issues).
- [ ] notifications for a slack channel as well, with the same settings as if it were a user, minus the assignment specific notifications. Objects are hyperlinked as with references. Includes user who made the change, if applicable
- [ ] references -- to be used in descriptions, etc. (popup search window?)

- [ ] dark mode xD
- [ ] email notifications when members are added to labs/projects
- [ ] Lab door access logs for security
- [ ] Equipment usage logs, interface with iLab & calendar
- [ ] equipment usage scheduling, google calendar
- [ ] user qr code for login
- [x] archive feature to hide old objects unless specifically allowed in the site-wide filters
- [ ] starred objects. appear first, after pins. database wide, not per user. starred images as well.

- [x] add file and image uploads to fabrication runs
- [ ] add settings change object to scans

- [ ] separate axis names and units, these should be added to the downloadable csv file in the form name (units). Fix automatic visualization titles & axes appropriately.
- [] add description field to images
- [x] add ability to upload other files (.kdf, gwiddeon, pdf, json, etc.) with name & description
- [z] add a team to the member heirarchy
- [ ] allow sharing between labs, when accepted will add the other lab as a link to the object, and give permissions to related objects (scans, samples)
- [x] allow users to add sample/project after a scan/queue is run by editing in the db.
- [ ] Add a "number of measurements" option for measurement objects. This will be configured like movement object positions (will require similar cards to be made for the scan setup page, that are visible when the measurement is selected in the scan tree GUI).

- [x] allow users to change default values in fabrication runs (if they are tuning something)
- [x] make parameters in procedures dynamic & configurable. e.g. deposition vs. photolithography will use a completely different set of parameters.
- [x] make equipment types dynamic & configurable within a lab (i.e. should be able to add new types, which will populate in the dropdown.)

- [x] Add images and files to labs and projects (like other database items)
- [ ] Diagnostics page for fabrication runs. Able to plot statistics by parameter, histograms or lineplots if numerical. statistics by user (instances of the error, in sorted error). statistics by substrate & sample material, by precursor id, plots by time of day and by time in general. plots by weathera

- [x] Site-wide filters need to be edited -- the button is visible longer than the Ui bar that it opens (frustrating)
- [ ] allow users to choose a lab in their profile, filters everything. allow labs to turn on/off database items they don't use -- wont show up in navlinks or index when that lab is selected for viewing in the user profile. allow labs to configure a custom color theme (three or four primary colors) that will be used when that lab is selected for viewing.
- [ ] publications -- link to scans, samples, lab, users, etc. Allows users to censor appropriately for a publically visible object that could be linked to from an actual publication (i.e. not to show description/notes on samples).
- [x] User statistics (labs created, samples created, etc. issues closed, images added, and some other cool ones (pages visited? idk))
- [ ] Autogenerated monthly summaries (created, deleted object numbers). # of resolved issues by type, split by object type (equipment, insturment, etc.). Upcoming maintenance tasks. Open issues. Plots of failed fabrication runs, and histogram of their failure modes (if there is enough data >10?). Users can select which of these they want to receive with checkboxes.

- [ ] Eventually: add automatic report generation that pulls from starred object
- [ ] Eventually: add the possibility to configure a small subset of lab objects to be made public  (available to all users to view, not just those with permissions). This will be like a lab website or group page. 
- [ ] Eventually: live polling to connected computers, ability to query to instruments from instrument detail page & check connection there. ability to start scans from other devices via connection through pybirch. Ability to check whether computers are connected. of course, computers need to be first class database objects for this to make sense.
- [ ] Eventually: migrate pybirch to jshtml with api
- [ ] Change "University" to "Institution"
