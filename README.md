Laboratory measurement architecture. Integrates with PyMeasure instruments to run scans over arbitrary dimensions, all from a simple, intuitive GUI. Tracks sample fabrication history using LablinQR extension; and passes data to a Wandb interface for real-time data visualization, storage and management.
