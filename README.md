</p>
  
Laboratory measurement architecture. Integrates with PyMeasure instruments to run scans over arbitrary dimensions, all from a simple, intuitive GUI. Tracks sample fabrication history using LablinQR extension; and passes data to a Wandb interface for real-time data visualization, storage and management.

### Database Web Interface

PyBirch includes a built-in database web application for managing laboratory resources. The database provides:

- **Sample Management**: Track samples with fabrication history, QR codes for physical labeling, and linked procedures
- **Precursor Tracking**: Manage chemical precursors with lot numbers, suppliers, and safety information
- **Equipment Registry**: Catalog laboratory equipment with maintenance schedules and documentation
- **Procedure Library**: Store and version fabrication procedures with step-by-step instructions
- **Project Organization**: Group related samples, equipment, and procedures by project
- **Issue Tracking**: Built-in issue reporting for bugs and feature requests
- **User Authentication**: Google OAuth integration for secure access

To run the database web interface:
```bash
cd database
python run_web.py
```
Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
